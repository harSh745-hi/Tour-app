# Tour-app
As part of my React learning journey, I built a small project called “Tour App” to practice core concepts like components, props, state, and event handling. ⚛️💻

🔹 What it does:
• Displays a list of tour cards with name, price, and description
• Each card has a “Not Interested” button — clicking it removes the tour
• When all tours are removed, it shows a message: “No Tours Left”
• A “Refresh” button brings all the data back 🔁

🛠️ Built With: React.js, JavaScript, CSS

💡 This helped me understand how to manage dynamic UI updates with React State. It was a simple but powerful experience!
